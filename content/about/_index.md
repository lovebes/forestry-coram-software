Coram Software is founded by yours truly to create software that is built for users. Spanning two startups and one mid-sized corporation, work experience has allowed exposure to tech stacks spanning ReactJS/ NodeJS/ Golang/ Python/ .Net Core, with use of databases in architecture settings involving Lab Information Systems, Data-Intensive Distributed Microservices, and Azure-centric Health Insurance Records.

The goal of Coram Software is in its name. "Coram" is Latin, which means "in the presence of". We want to create software that is mindful of being in presence of users. We do not want to forget that it is humans, users with intention, that will use the software we build.

Presence of users, but also in presence of our clients. We understand the many facets of how we are in presence of, and we strive to be mindful of that in all of our actions.

Such is why we have Accessibility as one of our core service offerings. Having been through a compliance cycle in a healthcare insurance company, it was apparent the importance of maintaining accessibility touched core parts of the product.
