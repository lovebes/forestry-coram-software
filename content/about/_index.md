Coram Software is founded by Seungjin Kim to create software that is built for users. His experience spans two startups and one mid-sized corporation - so always a student of the art of software development.

Even so, work experience has allowed exposure to tech stacks spanning ReactJS/ NodeJS/ Golang/ Python/ .Net Core, under architecture settings involving Lab Information Systems (LIS), Data-Intensive Distributed Microservices, and Azure-centric Health Insurance Records.

The incessant drive to find a platform or a language that would handle concurrency while bringing developer happiness revealed Elixir, and it's been the core focus of investigation - both professionally and as a hobby as well. Currently, the main focus and passion is creating web solutions using Elixir as the backend and frontend (via Phoenix).

While working with code in many facets and companies, there was this nagging feeling to create better, which led to Coram Software. The goal of Coram Software is in its name. "Coram" is Latin, which means "in the presence of". We want to create software that is mindful of being in presence - with the goal to create products that "just works" for the end users, while producing clean code and architecture to the extent of our skills, all while keeping the focus to be as humble, leading by example, and doing the best we can to help others with our craft.
