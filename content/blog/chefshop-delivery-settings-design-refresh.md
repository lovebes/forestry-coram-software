Crown jewel feature. Rarely do the modern e-commerce platforms have this feature, because most of the time you don't need it. But for bakery/pie/furniture shops, they've been asking for this feature - at least from what I researched in their community and in r/restaurateur  
  
And for cottage food businesses, I thought it'd be nice so that I know the max I can deliver, especially if you are working alone, and have to run for deliveries.
