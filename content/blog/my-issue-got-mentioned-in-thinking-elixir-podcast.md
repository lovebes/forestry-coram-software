## Wow! I got mentioned!

Err.. not specifically, haha but the issue I raised was mentioned!!!

[Issue](https://github.com/fly-apps/safe-ecto-migrations/issues/13) and [Podcast](https://podcast.thinkingelixir.com/178?t=757).

The article on it is one of the content out there about doing safe Ecto migrations,

and we use that at work many times to guide our DB related work.

So while looking at the guide I found a snippet of the example code which felt odd to me, so I raised an issue in the referred repo linked on the [article series](https://fly.io/phoenix-files/safe-ecto-migrations/).

My five seconds of fame, I shall cherish it and milk it for good ðŸ˜†
