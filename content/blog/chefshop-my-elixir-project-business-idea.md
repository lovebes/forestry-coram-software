# How I decided to create my first Elixir project

## Or, more like how I decided to do a food delivery business out of my home kitchen

.. legally. You see, in California there is what is called a [Cottage Food Operations](https://www.ocfoodinfo.com/cottage). 

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Here, see the alpha version in action. It's broken so the entire flow won't be seen.

### The beginning

This was in July\~September of 2020. COVID was rampant. Massive protests and BLM movement was near the end of the peak. Lockdowns. Masks.

And then Phoenix tutorials. Completing that made me dangerous enough.

I was at the cusp of what I should be learning after all of that.

Then, another need for myself to start any side gig came into play. Since our family has a pretty banging recipe to make glazed roasted nuts, at the back of my head I always thought perhaps something food related might be possible.

Add to that, I found out about the Cottage Food Operations regulation - where I can legally cook approved range of food and sell it. Only caveat is you gotta be delivering them. There's also another set of regulations called ["Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operations"](https://rivcoeh.org/OurServices/Foods/MicroenterpriseHomeKitchenOperations), where you can legally create small restaurants in your resident place, under set of rules. Actually reading through the rules was the first epiphany that they might something like what I am building.

### Arrogance or Petty pride, I opted to not use Shopify

How hard can it be? You list food, and then some sort of a food
