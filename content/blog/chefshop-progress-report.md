Well, this is a quicky as I have not been updating.

Project codename: Chefshop now has a website :)

[https://rusticfoods.cc/](https://rusticfoods.cc/ "https://rusticfoods.cc/")

Why the name? Well, this is a home cottage business, and "rustic" means home-related. I didn't spend much time here haha.

Most of my time has been spent trying to update the checkout process, to make it close to proven-flows that power fast food online websites.

It was slow. Mainly because I suck at design. But, at least something is working so far, at least in the fact that checkout works!

Now I switched gears to work on the admin side.

I even added dark-mode, which turns on at 8pm browser time, because the white glare was hurting my eyes haha.

As soon as this is good enough to work / manage orders and deliver, I'm going to switch gears, put on my business hat, and work on SEO/ ranking - again just bare minimal, following guides from [https://seoblueprint.com/](https://seoblueprint.com "https://seoblueprint.com/") (yep purchased it a couple months back, have been pretty helpful so far). I am not good with it, but then again I don't want to do nothing either.

Oh and I updated the release pipeline, as this post also got updated: [https://damonvjanis.medium.com/optimizing-for-free-hosting-elixir-deployments-6bfc119a1f44](https://damonvjanis.medium.com/optimizing-for-free-hosting-elixir-deployments-6bfc119a1f44 "https://damonvjanis.medium.com/optimizing-for-free-hosting-elixir-deployments-6bfc119a1f44"). 

Eventually I want to script out all of the work needed, so I can re-use it on other projects too. Of course, I have to figure out the DB maintainability/backup part, which I'm still pondering how I can do while keeping costs low (maybe Google Sheet can have a audit/backup of all orders/deliveries in the bare minimum?)
