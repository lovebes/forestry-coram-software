title = "Question: How to deal with Large and Long Standups"

+++
11 ppl is too large. Lemme guess. Only one lead and business wants all issues to be signed off by that person? And having everyone in one standup saves time fir the key decision maker?

Been there. Next best thing is split the project into 3 small areas. Three stand ups, max 10 min each. Overlap with only that lead.

For anything else, keep the discussion in documentations. It is hard and they get outdated, but 1.25 hours times 11 people at $60 to 70/hr salary is close to a thousand dollars.

Longer the meeting, harder to keep track of action items. Especially when impromptu decisions are made. Every decision you gotta hold decision makers (leads, business) accountable.

Docentation of meetings. Action items turned into Kanban items.
