Oh my gosh! Check this out - sending email from local to my personal email!

Using this awesome library: [https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo "https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo")

and its GMail Adapter:  
[https://github.com/parkerduckworth/bamboo_gmail](https://github.com/parkerduckworth/bamboo_gmail "https://github.com/parkerduckworth/bamboo_gmail")

...to which I made a PR to tweak the code to be able to use the latest major version of Bamboo: [https://github.com/parkerduckworth/bamboo_gmail/pull/9](https://github.com/parkerduckworth/bamboo_gmail/pull/9 "https://github.com/parkerduckworth/bamboo_gmail/pull/9")
