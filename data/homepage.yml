    job_summary: "Upwork Contract: Short-Term Rental owner seeking API integration for web apps (Hubspot, Stripe, OwnerRez)"
    content: Working with Seungjin was easy and effective. We achieved great results with our project, 
      and the process was simple to navigate. Seungjin took the initiative to dive right in and begin creating solutions to fulfill our contract, 
      and I was impressed with how easily he worked with our partners. For part of the contract, 
      he had to email our partner's customer service several times about their API, and I asked him to CC me on all emails so that I could stay in the loop, 
      but he was able to handle all of the back-and-forth himself. He always asked for input on crucial decisions, especially as they pertained to our operations, 
      but otherwise, he could handle much of the project independently. For a busy small-business owner, this was the perfect level of interaction. 
      I would recommend Seungjin for your projectâ€”you won't be disappointed. It was a relief to see how autonomously he could work, 
      and we're very grateful for the high quality of work he produced. His attention to detail is excellent, 
      and our solution is truly custom and fits our needs perfectly.
