      Client wanted to tasks involving [OwnerRez](https://www.ownerreservations.com/) and [Stripe Identity](https://stripe.com/identity). Client wanted OwnerRez updates on Guest / Booking information (such as editing or creation of new Guest / Booking) to be pushed into HubSpot as Deals and Contacts. Secondly, client wanted the [booking site](https://alpinechalet.co/booking)'s initial flow of verifying user identity via Stripe Identity to flow into OwnerRez's tags for Guest, so that when user verified the identity, a tag of "Verified" would be added to the Guest. Both tasks were done by webhooks feeding into [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/ "Title"), and writing the necessary code to map and call necessary endpoints to make the data end up in HubSpot and OwnerRez, respectively. Pipedream code was written in NodeJS.

Rustic Foods is a web application that handles online purchase and fulfillment for [Calfornia's Food Cottage Operation](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CEH/DFDCS/Pages/FDBPrograms/FoodSafetyProgram/CottageFoodOperations.aspx). Goal is not only to have customers seamlessly purchase food items, and also have admin process the order and fulfillment on the back office. CoramSoftware was involved from the [initial design](/blog/chefshop-released-and-building-in-public), and still is actively developing the web application. Frontend code to back office - was done in the PETAL Stack, ie. Phoenix, Elixir, TailwindCSS, AlpineJS, and LiveView.
